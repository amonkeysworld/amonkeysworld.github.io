With all the topics I have learned in environmental science, there is one concept that unites them all. It explains why people make the environmental choices they do; even more than that, it explains how animals like monkeys interact with each other, why I study for hours some days and others I listen to music and daydream instead, and where the motives behind the rapper Logic’s songs originate.

You see, these topics are all linked by the intrinsic battle of greed and compassion. 

It’s what drives monkeys to make the decisions they make: monkeys are greedy. They steal bananas from their friends, they block other monkeys from going in the shade so they can have all of it, they cause a lot of pain to other animals for food. But they're also compassionate -- that's why they take care of their families, they hunt for their group, they protect the weaker monkeys. 

It’s the reason I have days when I don’t study even though I think I should. I would rather be greedy, stealing the time I allotted and using it as a currency to spend on other things, than be compassionate to myself by prioritizing the girl who wants an amazing future. Greed and compassion alone are each addicting. Should you get addicted to both?

On those days when I don’t study, I listen to Logic instead. In “Come on Down,” he raps about Daquan from Southeast D.C. In the song, Daquan tells the Houdini of the music industry, “I want the world, I want the money, I want the respect.” On the first listen, you imagine a 35-year-old Daquan after three studio albums, two Grammys, and one failed marriage drowning in his gold and riches out of the greed that comes from fame and attention. Then, you realize on the second listen that Daquan from the future could look very different: he could sell his soul to the music industry, using all the profits to make a better life for himself and his family while spreading important messages to millions of people. It all depends on perspective.

Think about all these situations. They are analogous to how people act, who will externalize costs to the environment or to the health of others so they can make more money, but who have also formed advocacy groups to protect other people and organisms. The controversies in environmental science and policy would not exist without the discourse between these separate groups. They exist because people have to fight between greed and compassion for every choice that we make.
