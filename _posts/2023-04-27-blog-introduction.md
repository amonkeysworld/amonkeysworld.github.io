All you need to know as the premise to this blog is that I am listening to SZA right now while writing this. The point of this blog is to show you diverse perspectives and novel things going on in the world of environmental science -- the "monkey's world," if it's not too soon -- and have a little bit of fun while doing so. The blog is split into five sections: Book Reviews; Nikki's Takedown; Podcast, Summarized; STEMinism; and Advice Column.

**Book Reviews**

Here, you can find in-depth reviews for a ton of books. They aren't just about environmental science -- some of them touch on the topic briefly but were ultimately written with similar core values and motives in mind as environmental science books. 
For example, one article in this section reviews "The Life You Can Save," which presents common arguments for not giving and breaks them down logically as well as discusses the best ways for Americans to donate and help those who are living in poverty. I included it in this blog because it has a similar goal as some environmental science books, which is to help people combat the abuse and degradation inflicted upon others when they are in a state to do so. 
Other books talk about environmental science, but they are not just your run-of-the-mill-conserving-biodiversity reads. See, I'm a girl with **very specific taste.** If I like a book, it has fresh new takes . . . and all of said takes will be chewed up and regurgitated in this Book Reviews section.

**Nikki's Takedown**

This is my favorite section because I LOVE the sound of my own voice. Nikki's Takedown serves a dual purpose -- it acts both to share my opinion on how and where specific environmental issues can be addressed and as an opinion column about things that have been going on in the environmental world. 
While reading, you'll find yourself asking, *Uruguay did that HOW?* at the cultural shift Uruguay created to make clean energy a major part of its national practices and exclaiming, *Â¡No me digas!"* at the causes of the Puerto Rican energy crisis.

**Podcast, Summarized**

Did you guys know there's a podcast that goes along with this blog? It's called "Monkeyology" too, and you can find it wherever you get your podcasts.
Podcast, Summarized is a section for all the reading aficionados who don't like to listen to the podcast episodes or want a more succinct version.

**STEMinism**

I bet you noticed the pink that covers basically every inch of this blog. You see, one of the things I continue to keep in mind while working on this project  is that it is my responsibility to stress that authenticity and expression are important pillars of everyone's identity, including mine. In the past, dressing authentically to myself -- in a feminine way -- has been frowned upon and judged, but despite this negative shared experience among women in STEM, it is important to keep presenting how you want to, because you were meant to stand out! Femininity does not take away from intelligence and analytical ability.
That's why this section will be a shameless commentary on things like Legally Blonde's influence on feminism, the best makeup for the environment, and sustainable fashion tips. Keep being you!

**Advice Column**

You know those advice columns written in response to people nicknamed "worried girlfriend" and "boy with the blues?" This is basically that, but the environmental version. Send your questions to amonkeysworld@gmail.com or to monkeyology on Instagram. Letters from "concerned composter," "biodiversity bro," "precautionary polluter," and the like will be greatly appreciated.
