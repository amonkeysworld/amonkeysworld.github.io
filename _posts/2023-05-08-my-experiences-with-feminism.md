Ammonium thioglycolate can do amazing things -- it lets people take their 1A pin-straight hair to 2C curls after a single trip to the salon, helps girls *everywhere* find stylish hair to match their bone structure, and was a key piece of logic in Elle Woods's case in the movie Legally Blonde. I already have curly hair, though. Why should I care?

Here's why: when I watched Elle Woods solve the biggest celebrity murder case of the year, emphasizing ammonium thioglycolate's effects in a loud, booming voice with even louder Prada heels, something shifted in me. (There was an even more permanent change than, say, the one brought upon by an ammonium thioglycolate-assisted perm.) For the first time ever, Elle Woods showed me a representation of femininity and logic combined into one. Shortly after the first rewatch, I started coming to school with Elle Woods-type regalia, red dresses, fancy shoes, bold nails, and a red lip. Hoodies became blouses, messy hair became beachy waves, and I became myself again.

You see, in a small STEM school, it seems that fitting in is crucial to be respected: if you're not blending in, how can you be expected to solve a math problem as quickly as everyone else?

By dressing in feminine outfits, you are often seen as dumber than everyone else. Your ideas are ignored, your questions spark laughter and gossip, and preconceptions about your intelligence seem to rest solely on whether you wear a dress one day or jeans the other. It starts to become a choice. Which one, approval or authenticity?

Elle Woods picked authenticity. When she saw how her classmates responded to her feminity, she chose to look within herself, studying harder than ever before. She kept an open law textbook perched on her elliptical, used law arguments to get her nail tech back the dog stolen by her ex, and, ultimately, created her own law: *Make it happen. Shock everyone.* That's the thing. For so many people, femininity will always be seen as inferior and paired with a lack of analytical ability and problem-solving skills. It is therefore up to women to take control of their identity by choosing authenticity over the approval of others, although they will face backlash in fields like STEM or law.

When I walk into a room now, I acknowledge that any ideas I bring to the table -- about environmental science, environmental policy, whatever it may be -- are not undermined by whether my makeup is too heavy or not.
