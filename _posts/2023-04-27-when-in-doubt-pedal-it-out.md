I'm going to Italy this summer, and it's gonna be a HUGE adventure. The coffee shop I'm in right now is a taste of the experience: a rustic wood design, cute and colorful cups everywhere, people scrapbooking next to me. The only thing that's missing is the pasta, but one thing in particular makes up for it -- this coffee shop is in a walkable city. For this reason, it doesn't *matter* if the coffee shop has no pasta! You can find 5 Italian restaurants and 2 grocery stores in a 5-minute walking distance. Isn't that so much better than choosing to drive to get anywhere?

It's so much better for the environment, too. Data shared in the New York Times revealed the emissions patterns of people in America's cities, and a huge correlation was observed: near the inner city and in low-income areas, people tended to contribute a smaller emissions footprint.

This is because homes in the inner city are closer to shops (like I am to this coffee shop), and low-income people tend to buy less stuff. Let's explore these two factors further.

## Proximity to the City Center

When everything is within a 10-minute walking distance to somebody's house, it becomes easier and faster to just walk there than drive. Thus, the key to sustainable, emission-preventing city planning is *convenience.* If you can make everything someone might need and desire culturally and practically, they will not need a car anymore. 

People are also more excited to live in cities that are attractive and foster community, which is done through making them walkable. When everybody is outside walking around, coming together in various parts of the city designed for the purpose of community, a city becomes a happier place for the citizens and no longer requires them to drive to meet with their friends or their family. 

Emission prevention measures directed by city planners also include adding alternative forms of transportation. Then, even for people who live in the suburbs, driving will become unnecessary if a good public transportation system and biker-friendly lanes on the road are integrated into the city. These policies have to become an intrinsic part of how the city functions. For example, in my city, apartment and condo buildings are above restaurants and shops for the city residents. Bus stops are at every corner. There is a walking trail right next to the main part of the city. 

Ultimately, though, moving from the suburbs or the outside of a city closer to the inner city is impractical. It's not OK, though, to dismiss emission-preventing practices as impossible to adopt as an individual. We have free will, and there is *so much* that you can do! The next time you want to go somewhere that requires driving, ask yourself if you can just take the bus or bike there instead. I bet it's possible . . . and who would want to drive with those options anyway?

## Income Level

The big paradox when it comes to emission reduction practices is that the rich have the easiest means to reduce their emissions, but they have the largest footprint. This is because they can buy more stuff: among the super-rich, you'll find boats, cars, and planes. Why, though? The answer is seen in consumerism. People want more and more and more until their entire houses are full of things that add no happiness to their life. 

Having money doesn't automatically mean somebody is destined to have a huge emissions footprint. You can do things on the individual level, like buy less stuff, and on the community level, like create initiatives in your neighborhood or community to use public transportation, walk, or consume less. You can lobby for your local government to invest more money into the transit system and for your local school to teach about environmental policy and climate change. Being an individual in a big sea of consumers doesn't mean there isn't anything to do. By educating yourself about the factors that affect your emissions footprint, reducing those factors, and forming or joining environmental initiatives, you can be part of something bigger than you.
