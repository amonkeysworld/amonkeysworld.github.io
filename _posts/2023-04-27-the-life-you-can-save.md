This was seriously one of the best books I've read this year. It discusses, as the primary topic of the book, arguments for giving to people living in poverty and with disease -- whether it be through donating time or money. I love the way the book is organized, though. It's set up as "philosophy in the real world," using philosophical methodologies and their real-world examples as the main driver towards incentive to give. Although I have some objections to his structuring and methodology (which I'll discuss later in this review), Peter Singer provides a plethora of information that everyone should know.

I'll split my review into 4 (and a half?) sections. Let's get started!

**Part 1: Highlights**

This is going to sound weird, but I liked the discussion about Dutch disease starting on page 111. It was in the section "Improving Aid," which is all about the practical implications of donating (like potential problems that may arise with donating, which sectors are best to contribute towards, and how to get the most "bang for your buck" with donations). Singer explains that "Dutch disease" is a term used to describe the decline in the Dutch economy in the 1960s, which happened because the Dutch discovered a natural gas reserve that led to a huge influx of money and resources from exporting the Dutch oil to other countries. However, due to this initial economic boom, the Dutch currency became very valuable relative to their trading partners; thus, their exports were more expensive, making the country less competitive in the international market. Singer brings up this example in the discussion of how a huge influx of foreign aid could cause "Dutch disease" to occur in other countries, where the aid may be very substantial.

Another really interesting tidbit from the book was the discussion of how money affected thoughts of individualism and community (the "me vs. us" problem) starting on page 56. Here, Singer explains a study that ultimately showed that, by giving participants money, their sense of individualism was enhanced while their feeling of motivation and purpose towards their community diminished. This poses an interesting ethical question that precedes later sections of the novel - which purpose do we serve towards our community and the greater human race, and what must we sacrifice to fulfill that purpose?

**Part 2: Philosophical Arguments**

As a proponent of his arguments for giving, Peter Singer often uses utilitarianism, which describes the notion that actions are justified as long as they provide the "greatest net good" in the world - in other words, harm to one person can be justified if it helps dozens of people because this will create the most good. Using utilitarianism, Peter Singer aims to answer the question, "should we put our children's needs and desires above the needs of other children in poverty?"

The extreme case of this question would be whether parents should value their own child's life over the life of another child. My personal philosophy about this is that, although everyone has a moral imperative to help other people, parents have a strong bond with their child; the human nature to protect and nurture their child must not be ignored *to a reasonable extent.* For example, it is not justified to spend millions of dollars to buy the newest, most popular things when that money could be spent helping other children whose basic needs are not met. 

In *The Life You Can Save,* Singer aims to establish a threshold for how much we morally need to sacrifice and donate to charities. He states philosopher Richard Miller's ideas on this topic on page 146, who believes that "we ought to give to the point at which, if we were to give more, we would run a 'significant' risk of worsening our lives--but we do not need to go beyond this point." 

*Part 2.5: Counterarguments*

In Chapter 3, Singer addresses some "common objections" that people have to giving. Although all of his counterarguments are amazing (and definitely worth reading the book for!), my favorite was his answer to the argument that, although we are responsible for any evils that we inflict on others, we do not owe anything to other people. His rebuttal is that, with this view, we would have to abolish all social welfare programs, which is a very extreme case with which most would not agree. He goes on to say that, even with his original couterargument, the logic that this argument gives is not sound because the rich *do* harm the poor in the sense that the rich contribute to an unequal wealth distribution and the price of luxury products is externalized to the workers who created those products.

**Part 3: Practical Solutions**

After presenting moral arguments for giving, Singer provides practical plans for giving to charities. If you're interested in donating, you can go to the book's accompanying website, TheLifeYouCanSave.com. It has links to effective charities, a newsletter . . . and a link to download the book. *For free.*

**Part 4: Relation to Environmental Issues**

I wanted to add this section to argue that all of Singer's arguments for helping people in poverty also apply to helping combat climate change or contribute towards the solution to other environmental issues. This is for a few reasons.

First of all, over the next few decades (and even now), climate change is and will be causing thousands of people -- called "climate refugees" -- to flee their homes due to unlivable conditions caused by climate change. Thus, by donating to organizations that help combat climate change or working to combat the issue yourself, you will be helping people whose lvies are otherwise put to great risk.

Secondly, any environmental issue -- air pollution, eutrophication, lack of clean water access -- causes pain, suffering, and even death to the affected animals and humans. Therefore, all arguments about saving people whose lives and wellbeing are put in jeopardy apply to environmental issues, which cause these conditions for humans and animals.

I hope that, after reading this review, you decide to pick up your own copy of *The Life You Can Save*, either for free online or as a physical book. The philosophical arguments and advice that Peter Singer provides is absolutely invaluable.
